<h3>Archived on GitHub</h3>
<p>August 8, 2013</p>
<p>Uploaded all code, docs and binaries to GitHub to ensure they are always available to anybody interested.</p>

<h3>Last Program Recovered</h3>
<p>October 29, 2001</p>
<p>Today I received the last program I lost, the CC1 Org Chart Viewer.  Thanks to everybody that sent stuff in.</p>

<h3>Editing Community Lends a Hand</h3>
<p>October 6, 2001</p>
<p>I cannot believe the response from people that sent in files.  Within twelve hours of asking for the files I received every file except the Close Combat 1 Org Chart Viewer.  This was one of the reasons why I enjoyed making these tools back in 1998/1999.  Its really nice to see the community still as helpful as it was then.</p>

<h3>Save Game Viewer Posted</h3>
<p>October 6, 2001</p>

<p>I posted a previously unreleased tool for viewing CC3 save games called OOB (Order of Battle).  Not that useful but you might learn something from the included source code.</p>

<h3>Web Site Nuked</h3>

<p>October 5, 2001</p>

<p>I received an email from a CC2 player asking what happened to my site.&nbsp;
It would appear that NBCI shut down all the accounts and I must have missed my
notification.&nbsp; Maybe this is a blessing in disguise as it will force me to
update my site - hopefully everything is still available.</p>

<h3>Map Maker Updated</h3>

<p>January 7, 1999</p>

<p>Mick (Game Stats web editor) has put together a great package on making maps.
I have included a version of it with the Map Maker archive.</p>

<h3>Texture Maker 3 Posted</h3>

<p>November 24, 1998</p>

<p>I had a vision of what the graphics file format might be like for CC3. This
may or may not work but since they've dropped Mac support I bet it's close to
the same as before but with Intel style fields. This may or may not work but
will be corrected once I get the demo. Sure would have been easier if I was on
the beta team.</p>

<h3>Quibble Posted</h3>

<p>November 12, 1998</p>

<p>I've created another new tool called Quibble. This is for the people that are
about to kill Excel for not being able to save a file without that stupid .txt
extension. Quibble is rather scaled down spreadsheet program I whipped up on
Remembrance Day.</p>

<h3>World Viewer Updated </h3>

<p>November 6, 1998</p>

<p>I've created a new version of my 3D Height field viewer that uses textures.
It's not that friendly at the moment so download at your own risk. You will need
Map Maker to extract the height field TGA and the map graphic. Once the map
graphic has been extracted resize it to 256x256 and save it as a .bmp. Right
click to bring up a menu to select new files. I've added one of the more
interesting CC2 maps with the archive. Unless you have a RIVA 128 or RIVA TNT or
some other OpenGL accelerator you are going to get dismal performance. Since it
runs in a window (not full screen) voodoo 1 &amp; 2 owners are not going to get any
speed up. That said it should work with any system that has OpenGL installed. On
my p450 with a TNT at 1600x1200 I'm getting my monitor refresh rate (75fps).</p>

<h3>World Viewer Posted</h3>

<p>October 16, 1998</p>

<p>Well it's been a while since I've updated this site but it's still getting
hits so that's good. More than 1000... hard to believe. Well not too much of an
update, just a fix for all those people trying to get the 3D height field viewer
to work. I didn't include the glut32.dll that is needed. This DLL adds extra
code to make writing OpenGL programs a lot easier. Download the program, unzip
to a folder a type world map100e.tga and you should get a window you can control
with the mouse and mouse buttons. This is a total hack and is really just a
gimmick.</p>

<p>Oh yeah and just so you know I got on the CC3 beta test team... NOT! Damn.</p>

<h3>Los Maker Posted</h3>

<p>June 19, 1998</p>

<p>After making a request for people interested in doing a LOS generator Vincent
Viaud came though all the way with a handy little command line tool for creating
those .los files. Thanks for solving the last map making problem Vincent.
Download cc2los here (42k) with complete source code. The files are not quite
the same as Atomic but seem close enough. John Anderson mentioned that the los
program they use takes overnight, this one takes about 5 minutes on my P200.
Please post all feedback to the Game Stats editing forum for this tool and all
others so everybody can contribute to the discussion.</p>

<h3>Texture Maker Updated </h3>

<p>June 15, 1998</p>

<p>Updated my Texture Maker tools that I originally had posted on Game Stats.
The update now enables the tool to create the graphic files needed for maps
without requiring you to hex edit the files.</p>

<h3>Org Chart Updated </h3>

<p>June 5, 1998</p>

<p>Updated the CC1 Org Chart to use the release libraries so non developers will
be able to run the program. Thanks to Peter Fisla for pointing this out.</p>

<h3>Org Chart Posted</h3>

<p>June 4, 1998</p>

<p>Added an old Close Combat 1 tool that was never released. It is a
organization chart of your forces. I hope something like this will make it into
CC3.</p>

<p>John Anderson replied to an email of mine giving detailed instructions on how
to create a line of site (LOS) file. I'm not sure if I'm going to have time to
create the program so if anyone is interested in doing it I'll give you the
information and help you with the programming. It requites 2D algebra knowledge
and some intermediate programming ability (dealing with bit fields, file parsing
and line intersections).</p>

<p>Note you can two other tools I've written from cc2.gamestats.com. The first
tool is a texture converting tool. It's really handy with a hex editor to
convert to and from CC's graphic format and TGA files. The other tool is an
experiment in hacking the sound file format. It doesn't do anything but if you
are working on hacking that file you should check it out.</p>

<h3>Web Site Updated</h3>

<p>May 25, 1998</p>

<p>Added a screen shots of Map Maker and the height field viewer. They are
bigger than the programs (90k) but I know that I always like to see a program in
action before downloading it.<br>
<br>
I would really like to see some maps in work, send me screen shots of the
current work (jpg them first please). This would really give me incentive to
finish the LOS tool.<br>
<br>
John Anderson dropped by the newsgroup (comp.sys.ibm-pc.games.strategy or
something) and spoke up about Atomic's stance on editing. I'm really not sure
why people like to attack them so much. John has been great at answering my
questions, and I can see the point about not wanting to release a map editor
that produces maps not at the quality that they can produce them.</p>
