<h1>TOE - CC1 Order of Battle</h1>

<p>This program was written a long time ago but I sure used it a lot.</p>
<p>The purpose of this tool is to view the current state of your forces (and enemies if you feel like cheating).  It also shows the leadership organization.  According to John Anderson from Atomic squads perform better when they are closer to their team's leaders.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="https://github.com/gshaw/closecombat/raw/master/bin/toe.zip">executable</a>.  Source code is KIA.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Bob Crane for giving me the code and knowledge to read the Alunits and Axunits files.</p>
<p>To install this program, copy the toe.exe file into your %Close Combat 1%\games\myob folder and then create a shortcut for it.  This way the program will know exactly where to look for the files (in the same folder that the .exe is located).  If you do not do this and just trying running the program you will get an error.</p>
